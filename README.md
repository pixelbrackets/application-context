# Application Context

[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/pixelbrackets/application-context.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/pixelbrackets/application-context/)

The Â»Application ContextÂ« library allows to define the context of the current 
environment, in order to adapt configuration options depending on the stage 
an app is running on.

For example if an application is running in `Production` mode, it should
send mails and not create any log files. In `Development` mode however it 
should send mails, but to a different recipient, and create excessive log files.

```bash
export APPLICATION_CONTEXT=Development/Local/JohnDoe
```
```php
if($applicationContext->isDevelopment()) {
    // â€¦ do this in development mode only
}
```

[An environment variable sets the context](https://12factor.net/config),
whichs is retrieved using this class.

The main advantage of this approach is, that the code may stay the same on all
stages, but only configuration values may change, depending on the context.

## Requirements

- PHP

## Installation

Packagist Entry https://packagist.org/packages/pixelbrackets/application-context/

## Source

https://gitlab.com/pixelbrackets/application-context/

Mirror https://github.com/pixelbrackets/application-context/

## Usage

1. Set the application context using an environment variable

   A context may contain arbitrary sub-contexts. They are delimited with
   a slash. For example `Production/Integration` or 
   `Development/LocalMachines/JohnDoe`.

   The top-level contexts however, must be one of `Development`, `Testing`
   or `Production`. `Testing` should be used to run unit tests only.
   Use `Production` and `Development` and any sub-context for all stages.

   ```bash
   export APPLICATION_CONTEXT=Development/Local/JohnDoe
   ```
   or pass to the script like this
   ```bash
   APPLICATION_CONTEXT=Development php index.php
   ```

   ðŸ’¡ Hint: The package [helhum/dotenv-connector](https://packagist.org/packages/helhum/dotenv-connector)
   lets you store these variables in an `.env` file and automatically parse it.
1. Integrate the `ApplicationContext` class
   ```php
   $applicationContext = new \Pixelbrackets\ApplicationContext\ApplicationContext(getenv('APPLICATION_CONTEXT'));
   ```

   If the context variable is empty, then `Production` is the default.
1. Change code or configuration depending on the given context
   ```php
   $config['write-logs'] = true;
   $config['mail']['to'] = 'johndoe@example.com';
   if($applicationContext->isDevelopment()) {
       $config['mail']['to'] = 'test-test@localhost.tld';
   }
   ```

   Available methods to check the top-level context are `isProduction()`, 
   `isTesting()` and `isDevelopment()`.
   
   If the context object is casted to a string, then the return value is the
   context string as set in the environment variable. This may be used to load
   different files as in this example.
   ```php
   $configFile = __DIR__ . '/Configuration/' . (string)$applicationContext . '.php';
   if (file_exists($configFile)) {
     require($configFile);
   }
   ```
